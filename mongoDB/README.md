## Setup and Run the Script

### 1. Ensure MongoDB is Installed
Make sure MongoDB is installed on your system and a connection is established using the standard connection string:

```
mongodb://localhost:27017/
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the `server` directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

### 3. Run the Seed Script
Go to the MongoDB directory and run the seed script:

```bash
node seed.js
```

This will create a database "Smartrecipe" and seed the database with the necessary data.
